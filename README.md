Lily & Madeline Music
 My assignment 1 project and website is about two sisters, Lily and Madeleine who enjoy singing and creating music together from young. Since then, the sisters have gone on to release four full-length albums and more, showcasing their musical talents and performing. 

 My website aims to draw in a larger audience and promote Lily and Madeleine's music as well as encourage users to purchase their tour tickets. The website provides a brief summary of the sisters' musical exploration journey as well as the hardships they faced to encourage the audience to start listening and streaming their music. 

 Design process
 This website was designed with a color scheme of yellow, purple and navy blue. This colour scheme adds more livliness into the website to keep users engaged while still retaining their signatature edgy theme, compared to the original website's color scheme. 

 Features
 This website has five main pages showcasing different features. The home page allows the user to see what kind of music this band offers. The about page provides a brief description on the background of artists and what kind of music they make. The tour page allows the users to take a look at available tour dates and locations as well as provide a link for users to visit should they decide to buy tickets for the shows. The images page showcases a few professional photographs to give the user an impression of what the artists look like. The subscription page allows the users to enter their email address, name and country in a form to be able to receive updates through email.
