 Lily & Madeline Music
 My assignment 1 project and website is about two sisters, Lily and Madeleine who enjoy singing and creating music together from young. Since then, the sisters have gone on to release four full-length albums and more, showcasing their musical talents and performing. 
 
 My website aims to draw in a larger audience and promote Lily and Madeleine's music as well as encourage users to purchase their tour tickets. The website provides a brief summary of the sisters' musical exploration journey as well as the hardships they faced to encourage the audience to start listening and streaming their music.
